# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the existing department-focused frontend with a fully personal portfolio website for Afnan Tahib, featuring a dark theme with blue/purple AI-inspired gradients, glassmorphism UI, and smooth scroll animations.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove all existing department sections (Programs, Faculty, Labs, Placements, Research, Events, Achievements as department features)
- Implement a sticky responsive navbar with brand name "Afnan Tahib", section links (About, Skills, Projects, Achievements, Education, Resume, Contact), hamburger menu on mobile, and glassmorphism background on scroll
- Implement a full-screen Hero section with name, subtitle "AI & Data Science Undergraduate", intro text, two CTA buttons (View Projects, Contact Me), and an animated neural network/AI grid canvas background
- Implement an About Me section with college, degree, career goal, interests, and strengths in a card/two-column layout with scroll animations
- Implement a Skills section with animated progress bars or badge cards grouped into Programming, AI/ML, and Tools & Libraries categories with staggered scroll animations
- Implement a Projects section with two glassmorphism cards: "FUTURE_DS_01" (GitHub link) and "Sales Performance Dashboard – Superstore Analysis" (Tableau live demo link), each with title, description, tech tags, and action button
- Implement an Achievements & Certifications section with three subsections: Online Certifications (badge cards), Workshops Attended, and Hackathons & Research (placeholder/coming soon), with scroll animations
- Implement an Education section displaying B.Tech in AI & Data Science at Priyadarshini Engineering College, Vaniyambadi, as a timeline or card layout
- Implement a Resume section with a prominent "Download Resume" button linking to /assets/resume.pdf in a new tab
- Implement a Contact section with email, GitHub, and LinkedIn clickable icons/links, plus a contact form (Name, Email, Message) that submits to the backend
- Update the backend to accept and store contact form submissions with name, email, and message fields
- Implement a footer with quick nav links, GitHub and LinkedIn icons, and copyright line "© 2024 Afnan Tahib. All rights reserved."
- Apply dark background, blue/purple gradient accents, glassmorphism surfaces, hover effects, micro-interactions, and smooth scroll throughout all sections

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see a complete, responsive personal portfolio for Afnan Tahib with all sections accessible via smooth-scroll navigation, a working contact form, and a consistent dark AI-inspired visual theme.
